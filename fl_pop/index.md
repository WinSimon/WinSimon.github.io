##Florida work from home project

**Project Description:** For this project, I studied the number of Florida residents who work from home, by county. I used data from 2019, so this reflects numbers from before the COVID pandemic. As you can tell, Miami-Dade County has the largest number of people who work remotely. I then created a population pyramid of Miami-Dade County, in order to see if the population is young, or if it is aging, and if that might have an effect on the number of people who work from home.
