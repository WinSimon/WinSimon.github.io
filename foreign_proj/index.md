## Foreign-Born Baltimorean clusters project

**Project description:** For this project, I analyzed the relationship between geography and being foreign-born in the Baltimore area. I calculated the Gi statistics to determine spatial relationships between census blocks, and used that to create a map of hotspots and "cold-spots" with high or low populations of baltimoreans who were born outside of the United States.
