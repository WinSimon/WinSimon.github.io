### [Florida Population project](/fl_pop/index)
For this project, I studied the number of Florida residents who work from home, by county. I used data from 2019, so this reflects numbers from before the COVID pandemic. As you can tell, Miami-Dade County has the largest number of people who work remotely. I then created a population pyramid of Miami-Dade County, in order to see if the population is young, or if it is aging, and if that might have an effect on the number of people who work from home.

### [Foreign-born Baltimoreans Project](/foreign_proj/index)
 For this project, I analyzed the relationship between geography and being foreign-born in the Baltimore area. I calculated the Gi statistics to determine spatial relationships between census blocks, and used that to create a map of hotspots and "cold-spots" with high or low populations of baltimoreans who were born outside of the United States.
